# Ziggurat Simple Maps

## Description

This package allows the creation of simple tile-based maps for use with the [Ziggurat](https://pub.dev/packages/ziggurat) package.

Given a fairly specific setup, it is possible to use the [Map Level Maker](https://github.com/chrisnorman7/map_level_maker) app to construct these maps using a GUI.

## Shortcomings

I want to be clear: This is not *the best* mapping system. I wanted something simple that I could use to focus on games, rather than speed, so I'm 100% certain that anyone with a basic understanding (albeit one better than mine) of this stuff could optimise further, and such contributions are of course welcome.
